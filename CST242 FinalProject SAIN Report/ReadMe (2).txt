The initial username: admin
The initial password: pass


Using the UN and PW admin=pass login credentials will load up a view that is accessible by admins only. At this screen they can search for a Student by their ID number or they will be able to add a new student. The student will have a name, username, password, ID number, major number (using the hagis code) and a GPA. All of this is only set by an admin. 


        Using a login credentials created by the admin for a student will bring the student to the What-If analysis screen where they will be able to choose a major to view the SAIN report for. Once they choose the major it will bring them to the SAIN report screen. This is where they view all relevant to the Student and the chosen Major.
